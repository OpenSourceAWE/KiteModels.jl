## Kite power system models, consisting of tether and kite
The model has the following subcomponents, implemented in separate packages:
- AtmosphericModel from [AtmosphericModels](https://github.com/aenarete/AtmosphericModels.jl)
- WinchModel from [WinchModels](https://github.com/aenarete/WinchModels.jl) 
- KitePodModel from  [KitePodModels](https://github.com/aenarete/KitePodModels.jl)

This package is part of Julia Kite Power Tools, which consists of the following packages:

## News
#### October 2024
- the orientation is now represented with respect to the NED reference frame
- azimuth is now calculated in wind reference frame. This allows it to handle changes of the wind direction
  during flight correctly.
- many unit tests added by a new contributor
- many tests for model verification added; they can be accessed using the `menu2.jl` script
- the documentation was improved
#### August 2024
- a new kite model, KPS3_3L was contributed. It uses three lines to the ground and three winches for steering a ram-air foil kite.
- a first [ModelingToolkit](https://docs.sciml.ai/ModelingToolkit/stable/) based model was added, which shows a much better performance and easier to read code
- a new KCU model was added which assumes a linear relationship between the depower settings and the depower angle and thus is easier to configure than the original model.
- the drag of the KCU is now taken into account
- the drag of the bridle is now taken into account correctly, also if the real kite has more bridle lines than the model
- the function to find the initial state is now much more robust
#### July 2024
- a new groundstation / winch type is now supported, the `TorqueControlledMachine`. It can be configured in the section `winch` of the `settings.yaml` file. It uses a set torque as input.
- a Python interface is now provided, see: [pykitemodels](https://github.com/ufechner7/pykitemodels)
#### April 2024
- added support for the native Julia DAE solver DFBDF. It is much more accurate and faster than the IDA solver that was used before.

## What to install
If you want to run simulations and see the results in 3D, please install the meta package  [KiteSimulators](https://github.com/aenarete/KiteSimulators.jl) . If you are not interested in 3D visualization or control you can just install this package.

## Installation
Install [Julia 1.10](https://ufechner7.github.io/2024/08/09/installing-julia-with-juliaup.html) or later, if you haven't already. 

Before installing this software it is suggested to create a new project, for example like this:
```bash
mkdir test
cd test
julia --project="."
```
Then add KiteModels from  Julia's package manager, by typing:
```julia
using Pkg
pkg"add KiteModels"
``` 
at the Julia prompt. You can run the unit tests with the command:
```julia
pkg"test KiteModels"
```
You can copy the examples to your project with:
```julia
using KiteModels
KiteModels.install_examples()
```
This also adds the extra packages, needed for the examples to the project. Furthermore, it creates a folder `data`
with some example input files. You can now run the examples with the command:
```julia
include("examples/menu.jl")
```

## Advanced installation
If you intend to modify or extend the code, it is suggested to fork the `KiteModels.jl` repository and to check out your fork:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/KiteModels.jl
```
where USERNAME is your github username.
The compile a system image:
```bash
cd KiteModels.jl/bin
./create_sys_image --update
```
If you know launch julia with:
```bash
cd ..
./bin/run_julia
```
you can run the examples with
```julia
include("example/menu.jl")
```

## One point model
This model assumes the kite to be a point mass. This is sufficient to model the aerodynamic forces, but the dynamic concerning the turning action of the kite is not realistic.
When combined with a controller for the turn rate it can be used to simulate a pumping kite power system with medium accuracy.

## Four point model
This model assumes the kite to consist of four-point masses with aerodynamic forces acting on points B, C and D. It reacts much more realistically than the one-point model because it has rotational inertia in every axis.

## Tether
The tether is modeled as point masses, connected by spring-damper elements. Aerodynamic drag is modeled realistically. When reeling out or in the unstreched length of the spring-damper elements
is varied. This does not translate into physics directly, but it avoids adding point masses at run-time, which would be even worse because it would introduce discontinuities. When using
Dyneema or similar high-strength materials for the tether the resulting system is very stiff which is a challenge for the solver.

## Further reading
These models are described in detail in [Dynamic Model of a Pumping Kite Power System](http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6218).

## Replaying log files
If you want to replay old flight log files in 2D and 3D to understand and explain better how kite power systems work, please have a look at [KiteViewer](https://github.com/ufechner7/KiteViewer) . How new log files can be created and replayed is explained in the documentation of [KiteSimulators](https://github.com/aenarete/KiteSimulators.jl) .
